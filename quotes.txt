do you get deja vu when she's with you?
write me in your own words. \nturn me into melodies, \ninto symphonies, \ninto something.
down into a world \nwhere i do not need to be defined to be loved. \nwhere i do not need to be felt to be appreciated
she brought you into this world \nand she sure as hell will take you out of it
only miss the sun when it starts to snow
to be loved
i wish i could tell you how much you mean to me
stay with me
it is strange how we hold on to the pieces of the past while we wait for our futures
There is no greater sorrow\nThan to recall a happy time\nWhen miserable.
you said 'forgive me' i said you did nothing wrong
im getting too comfortable in my own skin again
you are everything good about me
elle m'aime un peu, beaucoup, passionnément, à la folie, pas du tout
you can love someone so much\nbut if they dont want to be saved\nnothing can save them\nnot even love
when you told me you loved me i thought i was dreaming
i look at you and see the rest of my life in front of my eyes
I will write you letters, messages in bottles, in cages, in orange peels, in the distance between here and the moon, in forests and rivers and bird songs.
but there's nothing i could do to make you love me
you don't need me, yet you wake up everyday and choose us.
I won’t say “goodbye” or “I love you” one last time.
I don’t want your heart. It’s not yours anymore, it’s just a heart now and I already have one.
And I will write you so many fucking dead friend poems, that people will confuse my tongue with your tombstone and try to plant daisies in my throat before I ever write you an obituary while you’re still fucking here.
你说我的眼睛灿若星辰，那是因为你是星辰，而我的眼中只有你。
太敏感的人会体谅到他人的痛苦，自然就无法轻易做到坦率。所谓的坦率，其实就是暴力。
youre so pretty no matter what
would you still love me if i was a worm
i waited\nand i waited\nuntil i realized i got stood up\ni got stood up by your love\nit never showed\nyour love for me\nnever showed
i waited for you to desire eternity with me\ni waited for our beginning to begin
you can think that you're in love when you're really just in pain
I love that word. Forever. I love that forever doesn’t exist, but we have a word for it anyway, and use it all the time. It’s beautiful and doomed.
But then it passed,\n as all things do.
but i'd rather have you this way than no way at all
When it's overwhelming, hold on tight\nI'll be here, don't forget it
We face stormy weather\nRain's pouring but it never lasts\nOnly gets better from here
i say it all like a promise isnt just a hopeful lie
nothing fucks me up more than my own thoughts
cant you see the way her eyes light up when she sees you?
say the word i'll be there
当你做对的时候，没有人会记得；当你做错的时候，连呼吸都是错。人不要太任性，因为你是活给未来的你。不要让未来的你讨厌现在的你。
人都是矛盾的，渴望被理解，又害怕被看穿。有些事，想多了头疼，想通了心疼。
真心等你的人，他总会真心等下去，不愿意等你的人，总是一转身就牵了别人的手。最尴尬的就是：每次都会高估自己在别人心里的位置。
am I overreacting or do I have a valid reason to feel the way I do : a novel by me
pretending to swim while all i'm doing is barely keeping my head above water
not all those who wander are lost
Do not stand at my grave and weep\nI am not there; I do not sleep.
I am a thousand winds that blow.\nI am the diamond glints on snow.\nI am the sunlight on ripened grain.\nI am the gentle autumn rain.
Do not stand at my grave and cry,\nI am not there; I did not die.
I feel very small. I don't understand. I have so much courage, fire, energy, for many things, yet I get so hurt, so wounded by small things.
if i cried in front of you, believe me, i reached my limit.
memory blurs, that's the point. If memory didn't blur you wouldn't have the fool's courage to do things again, again, again, that tear you apart.
put me first or don’t choose me at all
Go\ngo, I said\nand died\nwhen you left
i know everything happens for a reason but what the actual fuck
and all it took was a touch of gold
but the world is exhausted, and the only wealth we have left is love
We should kiss.\nNot because you passed my way by chance\nbut because you stopped\nand I haven't been the same since.
恋の予感
it's unfair that we laughed together but you cried alone
there are days that walk through me\nand i cannot hold them
but if you want me, i'm yours
darling, id wait for you - even if you didnt ask me to
i wanna be anything you've lost that you might be looking for
i want you, just you. in this life and the next
i hope your flowers bloom through the rain
closure like a deer in headlights
why's it so hard to accept the party is over?
I don’t want your lungs, just deflated birthday party balloons that can’t breathe anymore.
but does your mother know?
and every second i let you stick around feels selfish
My vanity is insanity unless it helps get you off
we learn from the ones we fear the worst
when i told you that loving you almost makes life worth it, i was not joking.
baby, why'd you go away? im still your girl
somedays missing you is an ocean and somedays it is drought
我喜欢牵了手就能成婚的故事，却活在上了床也没有结果的年代。
你的抑郁症是矫情，你的拖延症是懒，你的强迫症是闲得蛋疼，你的夜里失眠是因为清晨从未早起。
所谓陌路，就是最初不相识，最终不相认。
我以为时间是最好的偏方，没想到治好的全是皮外伤。
为你，千千万万遍，遍体鳞伤还是会义无反顾
i like you, but just like you
there's light up ahead
一些很期待的生活，总是在你自以为是的梦想中消磨了，然后给予你一个很失望的打击。
isn't it pretty to think so?
why anyone when xiao?
everyone needs their own lil delusional fan like xiao🫶🏻
have you ever met someone whose smile looks like it could make flowers grow?
but is it even worth it, losing yourself to win someone's heart?
i wonder how many things you think about before you get to me.
i don’t know to forget you, i don’t think i ever will
I hope they ask about me & I hope you tell them you fucked up.
i'm sorry, but i'd rather be dead.
i wanna scream on the top of my lungs until it starts to hurt
i wish i was loved in the way that i love others
my biggest fear is that people will see me as i see myself
the floor seemed wonderfully solid. it was comforting to know i had fallen and could fall no further.
idk why, but i really feel like i need a break from being alive.
sleep is my lover now, my forgetting, my opiate, my oblivion
and after all, red flags just look like flags when you see them through rose-colored glasses.
remember all the plans we made? was i naive for thinking we'd get that far?
let's fall in love for the night
if i'd do anything for you, that means, you know you could do anything to me
and, sometimes, i think i kill relationships for art
再美好也经不住遗忘，再悲伤也抵不过时间。
多少时候，因为得不到，所以假装不想要。
你说是我们相见恨晚，我说是你为爱不够勇敢。
你永远都不知道，我为你哭得喘不过气的样子。
再来一次的话，我还是选择爱上你，不过再有一次的话，让我先走吧。
sometimes we want what we want even if we know it’s going to kill us
what an impossible thing, breaking up, whispering promises to ourselves that other shores exist and then blindly wading out to sea.
they say it takes two years to come back down to earth
你背不下来的书，总有人能背下来，\n你做不出来的题，总有人能做出来，\n你愿意拖到明天的事，总有人今天努力做完，\n那么不好意思，你想去的学校也只能别人去了，\n你想过的人生也只能别人过了。
your apathy is like a wound in salt
I think the worst feeling is when you notice someone losing interest in you
dream of me when the sky is candy blue
I’ll forever be the person who says 'It’s okay, I understand' even when my heart is literally shattering.
pov: your toxic traits are isolation and avoidance but your love languages are quality time and physical touch
stop checking their profile, they dont miss you
Stop writing to people first and you will see how many dead plants you were watering
follow your dreams - michael
competitive programming can be done with a small brain, but not a small heart or appetite -  omeganot, 2023
oh, but my darling, what if you fly?
if i had a flower for every time i thought of you, i could walk in my garden forever
if it works it works - erick
we didnt realize we were making memories, we were just having fun
因为你太过于热情，所以总觉得别人对你都太冷漠；因为你太爱一个人，所以别人一个疏忽你都觉得那是不爱你了。
我会捧着鲜花去见你，在花谢的时节。
你是我猜不到的不知所措，我是你想不到的无关痛痒。
快乐是装给别人看的另一种痛楚，狂欢是留给自己痛的另一种寂寞。
最好的承诺，不是爱你一万年，而是根本不需要承诺
平时疯疯癫癫的和人笑和人闹，不过就是不想一个人孤单而已。
那场令人窒息的暧昧戏，抹杀了谁的志死不渝。
i hate newbies - thomas liu
sometimes we arent looking for a reason, we're just looking for an excuse
never expected the spring breeze to blow
its brilliant how we're always chasing after what we can't get
わたしの最後はあなたがいい \n あなたとこのままおサラバするより \n 死ぬのがいいわ
know that i loved you so bad i let you treat me like that
maybe its a blessing in disguise
you kept me like a secret, but i kept you like an oath
and a lingering what-if still on my tongue speaks measur
